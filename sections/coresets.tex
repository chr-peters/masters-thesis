\section{Coresets}

\begin{definition}
    Let $Z \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ be a set of points weighted by
    $w \in \mathbb{R}^n_{>0}$.
    Then a set $C \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times d}$ weighted
    by $u \in \mathbb{R}^k_{>0}$ is a $(1 \pm \epsilon)$-coreset
    of $Z$ for $f_{w, Z} = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i g(z_i \beta)$ if
    \begin{equation*}
        \ (1 - \epsilon)f_{w, Z}(\beta)
        \leq f_{u, C}(\beta) \leq (1 + \epsilon)f_{w, Z}(\beta)
        \quad \forall \beta \in \mathbb{R}^d,
    \end{equation*}
    where $f_{u, C} = \sum_{i=1}^k u_i g(c_i \beta)$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Lower Bounds}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 2}$, $y \in \{-1, 1\}^n$ be an
    instance of probit regression.
    Any coreset of $X$, $y$ for probit regression consists of
    at least $\Omega\left(\frac{n}{\log{n}}\right)$ points.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We first show how such a coreset could be used in a
    communication protocol for the INDEX communication game
    to transmit a message.
    Since there exists a lower bound on the minimum
    message length of the INDEX game (see~\cite{index}),
    we can use it to derive a lower bound on the
    coreset size.

    The INDEX game consists of two players, Alice and Bob.
    Alice is given a random binary string $x \in \{0, 1\}^n$ of $n$ bits
    and Bob is given an index $i \in [n]$.
    The goal is for Alice to send a message to Bob that allows
    Bob to obtain the value $x_i$ of Alice's binary string $x$.
    It was shown in~\cite{index}, that the minimum length of a message
    sent by Alice that still allows Bob to obtain $x_i$ with
    constant probability is in $\Omega(n)$ bits.
\end{proof}
