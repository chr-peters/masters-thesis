\section{Efficient Coreset Algorithms}

As we saw when constructing the na\"ive algorithm, there are two
main challenges that we have to deal with in order to make the
algorithm more efficient and suitable for large datasets:
First, we have to find a way to efficiently compute the
leverage scores, preferably without
having to perform a full QR decomposition.
Second, after obtaining the sampling probabilities $p_i$, we
need to be able to sample elements from the dataset
with as little computational overhead as possible, ideally
in one pass over the dataset.
We explore methods for dealing with both of these problems in this
chapter.
